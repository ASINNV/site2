#WRITE-UP

Project Success! Houston, fuck yo problems.


##THE GOOD

This project started out very well. I took time to consider my options before executing and it helped massively. The structure of the html document is on point. I learned new shortcuts for CSS efficiency and was very thankful for their arrival, the process went much more smoothly and quickly with their help. I followed the mockup nearly perfectly.


##THE NOT QUITE SO

My rendition of the mockup was not perfect. I had to make small sacrifices here and there to shorten build time and to leave frustration in the dusty hole it nearly clambered out of. There were a few places that would have needed too much research to make perfect, one, for example, was where the placeholders for my email, subject and message fields started. They didn't have a gap between themselves and the edge of the input field wall. That being said, it was a very minor problem and would probably be a quick fix after reading up on it. 

Towards the end, I noticed myself using superfluous classes to make up for sloppy work. When it came to the footer, I met friction when trying to workout the best way to handle the differently heighted and colored section wide bars that made up the footer. I ended up making two different sections to the footer, one called signature, I believe, and the other footer, and adding a bottom border to the latter of the two to produce the sleek and streamlined color strip at the very bottom. 

In the end I used work-arounds. I used to many classes and had to add superfluous information that would undoubtedly slow my website down and make it harder for me to read my work in the future. I still need practice writing immaculate code on the css end but I believe my html is up to par. 


##BAD

Nothing really bad happened. In the end, the site looked nearly identical to the mockup and everything worked fine.

##FEELINGS AFTER PROJECT

I feel, kind of, worn out. It was a long day and I hope to make my project much more quickly next time. Speed = happiness. Also I need to tell myself to remember DRY KISSes every time I sit down to a project. DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF, and KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID. 

I may feel worn, but I feel good and successful. Progress is positive and always makes my work feel worthwhile. Imagine progress on top of compensation, that'll be the real blast. I am finding coding really fun and I see myself improving. Can't wait to see what I accomplish next. Peace out Gentleman and Gentlewomen.
